# PeoplePicker

Translated by OOPer in cooperation with shlab.jp, on 2015/9/20.

Based on

Currently, the link above is not valid and Apple does not provide updated versions of this sample code.
You should better find sample codes using Contancts/ContactsUI framework, if you want to create a new app. (Exx. <https://github.com/ooper-shlab/MyContactPicker-Swift>)

This translated sample code does not support iOS 7, but still some codes supporting iOS 7 exist, which are actually useless.

As this is a line-by-line translation from the original sample code, "redistribute the Apple Software in its entirety and without modifications" would apply. See license terms in each file .
Some faults caused by my translation may exist. Not all features tested.
You should not contact to Apple or SHLab(jp) about any faults caused by my translation.
