PeoplePicker: Picking a Person or Property
===========================================================================

This sample demonstrates how to use the Address Book UI people picker and various properties like displayedProperties, predicateForEnablingPerson, and predicateForSelectionOfPerson. It shows how to browse a list of Address Book contacts to pick a person or to pick a person with an email address.

This sample also shows you how to use the people picker with the new 8.0 APIs and old 7.x APIs. This is useful for apps with a deployment target before 8.0.

Notes:
In iOS 8.0 the app using the people picker does not need access to the userâ€™s contacts and the user will not be prompted for access.
If the app does not have access to the user's contacts a temporary copy of the selected person is returned from the poeple picker to the app.
If the app has access to the user's contacts the selected person is returned to the app from the people picker addressBook property.
